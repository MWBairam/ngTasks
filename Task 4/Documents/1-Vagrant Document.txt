Vagrant:
========
-1)
-I created VMs in my local PC. 

-That cannot be automated using ansible since it does not have modules for VMware work station or oracle virtual box. 

-Ansible can automate VMs creation in AWS, ESXi, .... .

-2)
-Install vagrant from here to your windows 10 machine:
https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation
https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads

-Also you might need to use disk resize feature, so install it:
https://github.com/sprotheroe/vagrant-disksize 

-In oracle vbox, add a host-only network, called "vNet3" (as described in the lab layout, task1). COnfigure the subnet to be 172.16.0.0/16. And configure this host virtual adapter connected to it with an IP 172.16.1.3 .

-The vagrant VMs creation create in each vm a directory called /vagrant. It copies to it the Vagrantfile besides all the files within the same folder which are the .sh scripts.
-Once the VM is created, vagrant will execute the _setup.sh script i designed to configure IPs, /etc/hosts, and grub file.
$mount | grep vagrant 
vagrant on /vagrant type vboxso (rw,nodev,realtime)
$ls -l /vagrant 
//we will see the .di disk file, and our vagrantfile with other scripts got uploaded to here.

-cd to Vagrantfile dir, then >vagrant up

Note1: When vagrant is provisioning the vargrantfile, it creates by default one vNIC, and connect it to oracle vbox nat network. This will provide access to internet.
For the host-only connection between the VMs, we specified in the vagrantfile "--nic2" to create an additional vNIC and connect it to the host-only network "nNet3".

Note2: Just note that vagrant will create in each vm 2 HDs, root disk (/dev/sda) which is what we chose to have, and a configuration disk (/dev/sdb) with 10 megabytes.

Note3:After deployment using vagrant, you can from this windows 10 machine powershell get into the VMs with: >vagrant ssh _hostname, it is password-less login using a user called "vagrant" created by default in each VM. This user also is a sudoer by default.

3-)
-If we want to destroy the virtualbox VMs, we can cd to the directory of the vagrantfile, then >vagrant destroy.
